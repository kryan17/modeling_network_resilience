# modeling_network_resilience

Welcome! The purpose of this repository is to provide a demonstration repository of how to model network resilience using python. The focus of this demo is to understanding how changes in tower range and availability affect the ability of users to make calls or connect to towers. 

Key features of each file include: 
* networks.py: this file contains a basic definition of objects that may be of interest for network modeling likes towers, data centers, and devices
